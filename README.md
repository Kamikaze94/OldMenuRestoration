# OldMenuRestoration
####Classic PD2 Main Menu

This mod restores the old Classic main menu, instead of the newly announced new one, currently available in the beta.
As I am restoring the menu entries in Setup phase, and most mods as Fast.Net or CreateEmptyLobby add their buttons in Building, they should be compatible.
  
This is just for the worst case scenario, of the new menu being really unintentional or annying.
I have seen some mockups in the forum and on reddit, with really nice, improved versions of the new menu.
Please give the new concept a chance, when it gets released  ;)
